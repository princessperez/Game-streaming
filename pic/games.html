            <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows. A competitive shooter that pitches two small teams against one another. Your team is either set to attack or defend, with the attackers planting a "spike" (essentially a bomb) that the other team need to then defuse or, preferably, prevent you from planting in the first place.</p>

            <h3>Strong communication skills</h3>
            <p>Successful communication can deepen relations and can help as better understand for streamers to viewers</p>

        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="images/rsz_patience.jpg">
            <h3>Patience</h3>
            <p> it’s the value of patience. Growth of a stream is not something that’s going to happen overnight, or in a week, or in a month. I see so many streamers get into streaming expecting people to show up on Day 1, and their stream to blow up instantly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="images/compare.jpg">
            <h3>Dont Comparing Yourself To Others</h3>
            <p>This isn’t just a problem with streams that are small, this happens at all levels of streaming. Streaming is about fun and enjoying a game with a group of people. Sure everyone wants to grow, but complaining will never get you anywhere. If you feel like others are gaining growth faster than you, find out why! Are they more engaging as a streamer? Streaming is a constant learning process.</p>
